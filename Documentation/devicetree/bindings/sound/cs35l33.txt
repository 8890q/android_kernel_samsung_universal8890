CS35L33 Speaker Amplifier

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs35l33"

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C

  - VA-supply, VP-supply : power supplies for the device,
    as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

Optional properties:

  - cirrus,reset-gpios : gpio used to reset the amplifier

  - cirrus,irq-gpios: gpio used to simulate level triggered irqs

  - cirrus,boost-ctl : Booster voltage use to supply the amp, if this is not
    set then the internal 1.0V LDO will supply the amp.

  - cirrus,ramp-rate : On power up, it affects the time from when the power
    up sequence begins to the time the audio reaches a full-scale output.
    On power down, it affects the time from when the power-down sequence
    begins to when the amplifier disables the PWM outputs. If this property
    is not set then soft ramping will be disabled and ramp time would be
    20ms. If this property is set to 0,1,2,3 then ramp times would be 40ms,
    60ms,100ms,175ms respectively for 48KHz sample rate.

  - cirrus,boost-ipk : Booster peak current

  - cirrus,hg-algo : parameters for internal h/g algorithm that controls
    the amplifier supplies

Example:

cs35l33: cs35l33@40 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs35l33";
	reg = <0x40>;

	VA-supply = <&ldo5_reg>;
	VP-supply = <&ldo5_reg>;

	interrupt-parent = <&cs47l91>;
	interrupts = <3 0>;
	irq-gpios = <&cs47l91 3 0>;

	reset-gpios = <&cs47l91 34 0>;

	ramp-rate = <0x0>;
	boost-ctl = <0x0>;
	boost-ipk = <0xE0>;

	hg-algo {
		mem-depth = <0x3>;
		release-rate = <0x3>;
		hd-rm = <0xA>;
		ldo-thld = <0x1>;
		ldo-path-disable = <0x0>;
		ldo-entry-delay=<0x4>;
		vp-hg-auto;
		vp-hg=<0xF>;
		vp-hg-rate=<0x2>;
		vp-hg-va=<0x0>;
	};
